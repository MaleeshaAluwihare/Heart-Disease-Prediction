## Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a user having heart disease based on health-related data. The trained model can assist in early detection and prevention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains multiple features related to heart health, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. It is essential for training and evaluating the performance of the model.

## Model Training
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the dataset that indicate heart disease. The following steps are included in the training process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting the most relevant features for prediction.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to find the best-performing model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the model for predicting heart disease, run the following command:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/input.csv
```

This will output the prediction results based on the input data provided.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease. Detailed performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory.
